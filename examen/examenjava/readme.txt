The solution can be implemented according to the size of the matrix, by creating the threads one by one,
lik e the commented section
ok with an thread pool, this implementation has a better escalability as it allows us to solve for
matrixs with size more than>2.
Compile:
$ javac *.java
Execute:
$ java Test
