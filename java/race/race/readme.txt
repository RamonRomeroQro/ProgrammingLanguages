Use threads to implement a race between the rabbit and the turtle.
The rabbit is fast but is also lazy. This means that the rabbit will run 500 to 1000 (random) feet and then rest for a while for 100 or 200 mili-seconds.
The turtle on the other hand Is always walking at a slow pace between 3 to 10 (random) feet. But the turtle never sleeps.
Whenever either of them reaches the goal, the other one must stop.
Implement several versions of them where you change:
The lengnth of the race.
The sleeping time of the rabbit
The speed of the turtle.
Call the different versions from the main class and put the necessary outputs that will enable the user to see how each race behaves.
